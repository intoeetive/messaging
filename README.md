# Messaging add-on for ExpressionEngine

Messaging is the module for ExpressionEngine that brings all power of Private Messages, Bulletins (public messages) and Buddies/Blocked lists to frontent templates - even with AJAX support!

Private Messages are similar to being able to send another user an email. In this case, though, they access the Private Message through the EE website and not with an email program.

You are able to send Private Messages (PM) to one or several site members, add attachments, reply, forward. PMs can be organized in folders.

Unlike Private Messages, Bulletins do not get sent to each sender, but rather are viewable by all members of the member group(s) designated as recipients. Additionally, Bulletins can have an expiration date, making them ideal for mass communication of time-sensitive information. You can think of bulletins as Public messages.

You may organize site members that you communicate with into Buddies List and Blocked List. You may think of Buddies List as list of people you follow (or simply use it for easy access to selected profiles). Blocked List is the list of members from which you will not accept Private Messages.
